# Zendesk Integration Pipeline
A comprehensive data pipeline demonstration that simulates extracting, transforming, and loading (ETL) Zendesk support data for business intelligence and reporting purposes.

This project demonstrates a complete data pipeline that would typically be used to:
- Extract support ticket data from Zendesk API
- Transform and clean the data for analysis
- Load processed data into a data warehouse
- Generate business intelligence reports and visualizations

Tech Stack:
- Python - Main programming language
- Pandas - Data manipulation and analysis
- SQLite - Database for demonstration (represents SQL Server in production)
- Matplotlib/Seaborn - Data visualization
- JSON/CSV - Data serialization formats

Business Context:
This pipeline addresses common challenges in customer support analytics:
Key Metrics Tracked

- Ticket Volume: Monitor support request trends
- Resolution Times: Track team performance
- Queue Analysis: 
- Application: Whic
- State: 

Data Sources:
Tickets: Support requests with status, priority, assignments
Users: Customers, agents, and administrators
Organizations: Company accounts and hierarchies

Data Generation
python # Generates realistic sample data matching Zendesk API structure
generator = ZendeskDataGenerator(num_tickets=500, num_users=100, num_orgs=25)
Data Processing Pipeline

Extract: Simulate API data retrieval
Transform: Flatten nested JSON, clean data types
Load: Store in structured database format
Analyze: Generate business insights

Key Features:
Realistic Data: Uses Faker library for authentic-looking records
Proper Data Types: Handles datetime, boolean, and nested fields
Data Relationships: Maintains referential integrity between tables
Error Handling: Robust processing of missing/null values
Scalable Design: Modular architecture for easy extension
